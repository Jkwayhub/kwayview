# Kwayview Improvements Summary

## 🎨 New Sleek Logo
Created a modern, professional logo featuring:
- **Stylized "K"** with flowing curves (not clunky lines!)
- **App's dark mode gradient** (#0a0a0f → #0d1220 → #1a1a2e)
- **Blue gradient accent** (#3b82f6 → #60a5fa) for the K
- **Minimalist calendar icon** in bottom-right with "today" indicator
- **Subtle grid pattern** in background
- **Soft glow effect** behind the K for depth
